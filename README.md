# joblint

This branch was the frontend of joblint. We split this part into a new repo, [posting-pro](https://github.com/codeforamerica/posting-pro) because we plan on further diverging the codebases, and also needed a staging environment. codeforamerica.github.io/joblint redirects to the production version of that.
